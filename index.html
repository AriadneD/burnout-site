                    <p>It's crucial that individuals have the opportunity to pause and self-reflect, to check in with themselves. My goal is to offer feedback that prompts this reflection asking them to consider whether their day was stressful or not, for instance. Imagine your phone alerting you, 'You're nearing your burnout limit today.' Such warnings, even if initially surprising to the recipient, can serve as valuable wake-up calls. Many might think, 'I hadn't realized I was pushing so close to my edge. I need to be more mindful. 'It's about bringing to light those unnoticed moments of near-overwhelm, encouraging a proactive approach to well-being.</p>

                    <p>"The notion that we could phenotype people with available passive and active data is not only valid but makes a lot of sense. The idea of being able to intervene in ways that people wouldn't otherwise allow, or share is kind of exciting. Breaking through in such a manner, encouraging people to engage and respond in ways they usually wouldn't, feels like uncovering the secret sauce. It's about getting past the internal and external stigmas of mental health, in a way that's both innovative and genuinely impactful."</p>
